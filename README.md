# Phystack React App Template

Modern Vite-based React TypeScript template for building Phystack Grid Apps (kiosks, digital signage, Tizen TVs) with an AI-native development workflow.

## Features

- **Vite** — Lightning-fast build tool with instant HMR
- **React 18** — Modern React with concurrent features
- **Styled Components** — CSS-in-JS styling with TypeScript support
- **Hub Client** — Seamless integration with Phystack Grid infrastructure
- **TypeScript** — Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Analytics** — Built-in analytics schema support
- **Smart Settings** — Priority-based settings system (downloaded vs schema defaults)
- **Vitest** — Test infrastructure with React Testing Library
- **AI-Native Workflow** — Self-configuring agents, TDD skills, and self-improving rules

<!-- /feature: Update this section as features are implemented -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn (enforced via preinstall hook)
- [@phystack/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phystack/cli) for deployment

### Quick Start (AI-Assisted)

Then run `/setup` in Claude Code to configure this template for your app. It will:

1. Ask what you're building (interactive Q&A)
2. Generate a Product Requirements Document
3. Decompose into numbered feature specs
4. Generate architecture docs (screen flow, schema design, signals)
5. Customize AI agents and rules for your specific app

After setup, build features with `/feature 001-base-layout`.

### Quick Start (Manual)

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

The dev server automatically:

1. Generates settings from schema defaults (ephemeral)
2. Starts Vite dev server with HMR on http://localhost:3000
3. Watches for schema changes and regenerates settings

## Settings Workflow

The template uses a **priority-based settings system**:

### Priority Order

1. **`src/settings/index.json`** - Downloaded from installation (persistent, gitignored)
2. **`src/settings/.generated.json`** - Generated from schema (ephemeral, auto-created)

### Development Workflows

**Using schema defaults (ephemeral):**

```bash
yarn dev
# ✅ Auto-generates .generated.json from src/schema.ts
# ✅ Always fresh - regenerated on every dev run
# ✅ Perfect for local development
```

**Using real installation data (persistent):**

```bash
yarn download-settings <installation-name>
# ✅ Downloads to src/settings/index.json
# ✅ Takes priority over .generated.json
# ✅ Persists across dev runs

yarn dev
# ✅ Uses downloaded settings
# ✅ Still regenerates .generated.json (as fallback)
```

**Switch back to schema defaults:**

```bash
rm src/settings/index.json
yarn dev
# ✅ Falls back to .generated.json
```

## Configuration

### Settings Schema

Edit `src/schema.ts` to define your app settings:

```typescript
/**
 * @title My App Settings
 */
export type Settings = {
  /**
   * @title Product Name
   * @default "My Product"
   */
  productName: string;

  /**
   * @title Product Price
   * @default "99 USD"
   */
  productPrice: string;
};

export default Settings;
```

The `@default` annotations are used to generate `src/settings/.generated.json`.

### Analytics

Edit `src/analytics-schema.ts` to customize analytics dashboards:

```typescript
import {
  AnalyticsSchema,
  CardType,
  SessionInteractionType,
} from "@ombori/grid-reports";

const analyticsSchema: AnalyticsSchema = {
  groups: [
    {
      name: "Overview",
      cards: [
        {
          type: CardType.Sessions,
          interactionType: SessionInteractionType.Interactive,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

export default analyticsSchema;
```

### Environment Variables

- `PUBLIC_URL` - Base path for deployment (CRA compatibility)
- `VITE_ROOT_PATH` - Alternative base path (Vite-specific)
- `DEV` - Development mode flag (auto-set by Vite)

### Custom Base Path

```bash
# For deployment to subdirectory
PUBLIC_URL=/my-app yarn build

# Or using Vite-specific variable
VITE_ROOT_PATH=/my-app yarn build
```

## Build Output

The build process generates:

```
build/
├── static/
│   ├── js/           # JavaScript bundles
│   ├── css/          # CSS files
│   └── svg/          # SVG assets
├── index.html
├── asset-manifest.json    # Deployment manifest (omg-deploys compatible)
├── _schema.json          # Settings schema
├── _meta-schema.json     # Analytics schema
└── package.json          # Package metadata
```

## Browser Compatibility

### Target Platforms

✅ **Tizen 4** - Samsung Smart Signage (Chrome 56-63 equivalent)
✅ **Modern Browsers** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

The build is configured for ES2015 (ES6) to support Tizen 4 devices while maintaining modern development experience.

### Build Target

- **Development**: Modern ES modules with HMR
- **Production**: ES2015 (transpiled for Tizen 4 compatibility)

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
build: {
  target: 'es2015', // Tizen 4 compatible
}
```

## Compatibility

✅ Compatible with:

- Tizen 4 devices (Samsung Smart Signage)
- omg-deploys Azure Functions
- @phystack/cli deployment tools
- screen-boot deployment system
- CRA environment variables
- React 18+ concurrent features

## Modern React Patterns

This template follows React 18 best practices:

- ✅ Uses `createRoot()` API (not deprecated `ReactDOM.render()`)
- ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect with cancellation flags
- ✅ Error boundaries and error state handling
- ✅ No unnecessary `useCallback`/`useMemo` (kept simple)
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Modern imports (no `import React`)

## Deployment

### Publishing to Phystack Grid

```bash
# Build the app
yarn build

# Publish to grid
yarn pub

# Upload description and screenshots
yarn upload-description
```

### Setting Up in Console

1. Go to Phystack Console
2. Create installation
3. Add your app
4. Configure settings via UI or upload custom settings

### Downloading Settings for Development

```bash
# Download from specific installation
yarn download-settings <installation-name>

# Now dev mode uses real installation data
yarn dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### Settings not loading

```bash
# Check if settings exist
ls -la src/settings/

# Regenerate from schema
rm -rf src/settings/
yarn dev
```

### Build fails

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf build node_modules
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Hub client connection fails in dev

Make sure you're using schema-generated settings:

```bash
rm src/settings/index.json  # Remove downloaded settings
yarn dev                     # Use schema defaults
```

## AI Development Workflow

This template includes a self-configuring AI development system:

| Skill               | Purpose                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/setup`            | Configure the template for your app (generates PRD, features, architecture, design, customizes agents) |
| `/feature NNN-name` | TDD workflow with design-first specs, reflection, and continuous improvement                    |
| `/learn`            | Capture corrections as reusable rules                                                          |
| `/stability-audit`  | Audit for always-on device stability issues                                                    |

### Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `ui-developer` | Builds React screen components with TDD, following design specs |
| `schema-developer` | Maintains settings schema and analytics config |
| `ux-designer` | Creates design specs, wireframes, interaction flows, and branding |
| `reviewer` | Validates changes against architecture, design, UX, and code quality |

The system improves with use — each completed feature updates documentation, agents, and rules based on what was learned during implementation.
