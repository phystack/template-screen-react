# Project Brief Template

This directory contains the Project Brief for this app, generated by `/setup`.

## Lifecycle

The brief has a defined lifecycle tracked by frontmatter `status`:
- **`active`** — Brief is the primary specification (before feature decomposition)
- **`decomposed`** — Features have been created; brief is now a historical document
- **`superseded`** — Brief has been replaced by a new one (rare, e.g., major pivot)

After `/setup` decomposes the brief into features, the brief becomes a **read-only historical document**. Features are the living specifications going forward.

## Brief Structure

```markdown
---
status: active | decomposed | superseded
created: YYYY-MM-DD
decomposed: YYYY-MM-DD

```

### 1. Overview
- App name, one-line description
- Target users
- Hardware & environment
- Interaction model
- Primary goal

### 2. Jobs to Be Done
Solution-agnostic job statements that anchor the project to user needs:

```
### J-001: [Job Title]
**When** [situation], **I want to** [motivation], **so I can** [outcome].
**Context**: [Why this job matters, frequency, emotional dimension]
```

Jobs are stable over time — even if features change, the jobs stay valid.

### 3. Screen Inventory
| Screen | Description | Jobs Served |
|--------|-------------|-------------|

### 4. Settings Schema Design
- Groups, types, defaults
- Enough detail for schema-developer to implement

### 5. Technical Context
- PhyStack Integration (Hub Client, Queue, Products, Signals, Twin)
- Hardware & Environment (device, peripherals, constraints)
- Compatibility (ES2015/Tizen, accessibility level, i18n)

### 6. Feature Decomposition
| # | Feature | Jobs | Priority | Depends On | Size |
|---|---------|------|----------|------------|------|
