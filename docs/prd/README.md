# PRD Format Guide

This directory contains the Product Requirements Document for this app, generated by `/setup`.

## PRD Structure

A PhyStack screen app PRD should cover:

### 1. Overview
- App name, one-line description, target users
- Hardware context (target device and environment)
- Interaction model (touch, passive, scanner, camera, etc.)

### 2. Screen Inventory
- List of all screens/views with descriptions
- Screen flow diagram (Mermaid state diagram)
- Session lifecycle (idle → active → complete → idle)

### 3. Settings Schema Design
- All configurable content grouped by category
- Data types and JSDoc annotations
- Default values
- Widget hints (@ui, @widget, @format)

### 4. PhyStack Integration
- Hub Client usage (settings, signals, modules)
- Products SDK needs (if product catalog used)
- Analytics events and signals plan
- Twin messaging (if real-time updates needed)

### 5. Hardware & Environment
- Target devices and hardware specifications
- Peripherals (scanner, camera, printer, payment)
- Connectivity assumptions
- Performance constraints

### 6. Constraints
- ES2015/Tizen compatibility requirements
- Accessibility requirements
- Multi-language support needs
- Privacy and data handling

### 7. UX Design
- Design system reference (`docs/design/design-system.md`)
- Personas summary (from `docs/design/personas.md`)
- Wireframe references (`docs/design/wireframes.md`)
- Interaction model rationale (why touch/passive/scanner was chosen)
- Accessibility target (WCAG level and key requirements)

### 8. Feature Decomposition
- Numbered feature list with priorities
- Dependencies between features
- Estimated complexity (S/M/L)
