# Feature Specs

This directory contains individual feature specifications, generated by `/setup` and updated during development.

## Naming Convention

Feature specs follow the pattern: `NNN-feature-name.md`

- `NNN` = three-digit number (001, 002, ...) indicating recommended implementation order
- `feature-name` = kebab-case description

## Lifecycle

1. **Generated** by `/setup` during onboarding
2. **Refined** during `/feature` planning phase
3. **Updated** during implementation (schema changes, new requirements)
4. **Completed** by `/feature` reflect step (status set to `complete`)

## Feature Status

Each spec has a `status` field in its frontmatter:
- `pending` — Not yet started
- `in-progress` — Currently being implemented
- `complete` — Implementation done, tests passing, PR merged

## Working with Features

```
/feature NNN-feature-name    # Start TDD workflow for this feature
```

If no spec exists for the feature name, `/feature` will create one interactively.

## Template

See `_template.md` for the feature spec format.
