# Learned Patterns

Patterns discovered during development, captured by `/feature` reflection and `/learn` corrections.

This file starts empty and grows as the team builds features. Each pattern includes:
- When it was learned
- What triggered the learning
- The rule with code examples

<!-- Patterns will be added below as they are discovered -->
