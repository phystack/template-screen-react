# App-Specific Rules

This file is populated by `/setup` with domain-specific rules for the app being built.

Before `/setup` is run, no app-specific rules exist. After `/setup`:
- Domain-specific patterns and constraints will be documented here
- Rules are based on the app's PRD and architecture decisions
- Updated by `/feature` reflect step and `/learn` skill

<!-- /setup will replace this content with app-specific rules -->
